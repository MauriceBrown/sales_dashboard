# Sales Dashboards created in Excel and Power BI

This project consists of two dashboards made using [sample data from microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/sample-sales-and-marketing#get-the-pbix-file-for-this-sample). Both dashboards use Power Query to create a realtional data model from which the dashboards are created. The model schema diagram is shown below.
