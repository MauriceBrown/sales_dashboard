# Sales Dashboards created in Excel and Power BI

## Project Overview
This project consists of two dashboards made using [sample data from microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/sample-sales-and-marketing#get-the-pbix-file-for-this-sample). Both dashboards use Power Query to create a realtional data model from which the dashboards are created. The model schema diagram is shown below.

## Downloading and using the dashboards
The data for these projects is hosted in the [tsv_files folder of this repo](https://github.com/MauriceBrown/sales_dashboard/tree/main/tsv_files) making it easy to share the Excel and PowerBI files. In order to use the dashboards, just [download the Excel file](https://github.com/MauriceBrown/sales_dashboard/raw/main/Sales%20Dashboard.xlsx) or [download the Power BI file](https://github.com/MauriceBrown/sales_dashboard/raw/main/Sales%20Dashboard.pbix) and start interacting with the dashboards. Any data they require will be automatically downloaded from this repo.

## Excel Dashboard
This dashboard shows revenue and unit sales by manufacturer over time. There is a slicer to select manufacturers (multi-select is enabled) as well as a timelime to select a date range.

## Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI report shows a series of dashboards including custom tooltips, drill-through pages and custom measures calculated using DAX.
